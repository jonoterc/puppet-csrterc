puppet-csrterc
==============

Puppet module gathering other modules for managing web development, testing, and production environments for CSR

Currently many module dependencies are git-based (vs. forge-based), so standard module-based 
dependency resolution may not be sufficient (i.e. this modules dependencies will need to be
manually installed)
